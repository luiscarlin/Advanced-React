# Notes

## NextJS
- server side rendering
- does pages and creating layout
- routing based on directory structure
- does webpack for you configuration
- framework. Does all the tooling for you behind the scenes
- SEO/ preloading/ code splitting
- getInitialProps => wait for data to resolve

## Apolo
- replaces redux
- performs mutation of data
- does caching/ app state

## Prisma
- provides interface APIs to CRUD operations in database
- we will interface with this API
- provides GraphQL
- open source library
- sits on top of a database
- provides a graphql api to do CRUD operations
- you can run your own prisma as well as DB

## GraphQL Yoga
- query and mutation resolvers
- service side logic
- authentication and permissions
- sending emails

## GraphQL
- specification/ standard to serve and receive data
- agnostic to language and what the "consumer" is
- replaces rest or it can wrap rest
- single endpoint
- returns json with only the data you requested
- data has to be typed
- by default there is no querying functions like sorting, filter, etc
